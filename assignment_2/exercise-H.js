//Update the file exercise-H.js script in the folder week-1/InClass
//Design and create a function that:
    //takes in more than one input
    //uses string concatenation
    //this means adding two strings together
    //performs some form of operation on a number
    //uses return to return a string
//Add a comment above your function to explain what it does
//Call your function and run your script
//What's the difference between a return and console.log?
//When would you choose to use functions over the way we have been scripting so far?

//my function will multiply two numbers together
function multiply(num1, num2) {
    return (num1 * num2);
  }
const result = (multiply);

console.log(result);
